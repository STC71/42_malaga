Reproduce the behavior of the function strcmp (man strcmp).

Your function must be declared as follows:

int    ft_strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

The  strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2. The locale is not
taken into account (for a locale-aware comparison, see strcoll(3)).  The com‐
parison is done using unsigned characters.

strcmp()  returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

• 0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;

• a negative value if s1 is less than s2;

• a positive value if s1 is greater than s2.
