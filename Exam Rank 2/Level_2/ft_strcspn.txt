---------------------------------------------------------------

Reproduce exactly the behavior of the function strcspn
(man strcspn).

The function should be prototyped as follows:

size_t	ft_strcspn(const char *s, const char *reject);

The strcspn() function calculates the length of the initial  
segment of s which consists entirely of bytes not in reject.

The strcspn() function returns the number of bytes in the 
initial segment of s which are not in the string reject.
